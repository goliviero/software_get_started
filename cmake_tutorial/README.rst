Introduction
============

What is cmake?
--------------

The CMake  tutorial provides a  step-by-step guide that  covers common
build  system issues  that  CMake helps  address.  Seeing how  various
topics all work together in an example project can be very helpful.

The    main     documentation    page     can    be     found    here:
https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html. It is a
step by  step tutorial.  For lots  of use case  only step  1 to  6 are
relevant and useful so we will limit ourselves to them. You can finish
the tutorial if you want.

The tutorial  documentation and source  code examples can be  found in
the ``Help/guide/tutorial`` directory of the CMake source code tree in
this                         github                        repository:
https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/tree/master/Help/guide/tutorial


Steps
=====

Each step has its own subdirectory containing code that may be used as
a starting point.  The tutorial examples are progressive  so that each
step provides the complete solution for the previous step.


- Step 1: A Basic Starting Point
- Step 2: Adding a Library
- Step 3: Adding Usage Requirements for a Library
- Step 4: Adding Generator Expressions
- Step 5: Installing and Testing
- Step 6: Adding Support for a Testing Dashboard

Whenever a step above is renamed  or removed, leave forwarding text in
its original document file, and list it below to preserve old links to
cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/ URLs.
