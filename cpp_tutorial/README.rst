Introduction
============

What is C++?
------------

C++  is a  high-level  programming  language that  is  widely used  in
software  development,  particularly  for building  systems  software,
embedded systems, and large-scale applications.

C++ is a compiled language, which  means that code written in C++ must
be compiled into machine  code before it can be run.  C++ is known for
its performance, efficiency, and flexibility,  and it is often used in
applications  that  require  high-speed processing,  such  as  gaming,
finance, and scientific computing.

Getting Started with C++
-------------------------

To get started with C++, you'll  need a C++ compiler and an integrated
development  environment  (IDE)  to  write, compile,  and  debug  your
code. There are  many C++ compilers and IDEs available,  both free and
commercial.

Some popular C++ compilers include:

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Clang
- Visual C++

Some popular C++ IDEs include:

- Visual Studio
- Eclipse
- Code::Blocks
