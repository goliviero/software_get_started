Introduction
============

What is ROOT?
-------------

The  ROOT CERN  language  is  a powerful  tool  for  data analysis  in
high-energy  physics,  used extensively  by  researchers  at CERN  and
beyond.  It  provides a  framework  for  storing and  analyzing  large
datasets, as well as tools for creating complex data visualizations.

The  ROOT  CERN language  is  built  on  top  of the  C++  programming
language, and includes  a number of powerful features  specific to the
needs of high-energy physics research.  Some of the features that make
ROOT CERN useful for data analysis include:

- A powerful library of  data analysis tools, including histogramming,
  fitting, and multivariate analysis
- Tools for creating complex data  visualizations, including 2D and 3D
  plots and interactive graphics
- A flexible and extensible framework  for storing and analyzing data,
  including support for a variety  of data formats and interfaces with
  other languages and tools
- High performance  and scalability,  allowing researchers  to analyze
  large datasets efficiently

Getting Started with ROOT CERN
------------------------------

To get started with ROOT CERN, you'll need to download and install the
software. You  can download the latest  version of ROOT CERN  from the
official website at https://root.cern.ch/.

Once you have  ROOT CERN installed, you can start  using it to analyze
data. Some common tasks you might perform with ROOT CERN include:

- Loading data into ROOT CERN using the TTree class
- Creating histograms and other visualizations of your data
- Performing statistical analyses, such as fitting data to a model
- Interacting  with   your  data  using  the   ROOT  CERN  interactive
  command-line interface
