Introduction
============

What is boost?
--------------

The  Boost  C++  Libraries  are a  set  of  high-quality,  open-source
software  libraries   that  extend   the  functionality  of   the  C++
programming  language. They  are widely  used by  developers to  write
efficient and reusable code, and offer  a range of tools and utilities
that can be useful for PhD students working on research projects.

The Boost library  includes a wide range of modules  that can help you
tackle many common programming tasks, including:

- Container classes for managing collections  of data, such as arrays,
  linked lists, and maps.
- Algorithms for sorting, searching, and manipulating data in memory.
- String processing utilities for working with text data.
- Concurrent  programming utilities  for writing  efficient, scalable,
  and thread-safe code.
- File  system utilities  for working  with files  and directories  on
  disk.
- Math and  numeric utilities for performing  complex calculations and
  statistical analysis.
- And much more!

Getting Started with Boost
--------------------------

To get  started with the  Boost library,  you'll need to  download and
install it on your development environment. The Boost website provides
detailed  instructions on  how to  download and  install the  library,
along with tutorials and documentation to help you get started.

Once you have installed the Boost library, you can start exploring its
modules and using its utilities in your own code. Boost is designed to
be  easy to  use and  integrate with  your existing  codebase, so  you
should be able to start using it right away.
