Contents
========

- ``slides.tex`` main latex beamer document

- ``img/`` directory where we will put all images

- ``Makefile``  not  mandatory  but  nice to  have.  Use  ``make``  to
  generate the pdf file and use  ``make clean`` to remove all produced
  files in the directory during ``pdflatex generation.


In the ``slides.tex`` main document, you can choose the theme for your
presentation using ``\usetheme{ThemeName}``, here  the theme chose was
``Warsaw``.
