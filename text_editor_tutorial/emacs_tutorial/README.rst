Introduction
============

What is emacs?
--------------

Emacs  is not  just  a text  editor, but  a  complete environment  for
editing, writing,  and programming.  It comes with  a wide  variety of
features,  including  syntax  highlighting,  auto-completion,  and  an
extensible architecture that allows you  to add your own functionality
and customize your workflow to your needs.

One  of  the most  powerful  features  of  Emacs  is its  support  for
different programming languages, including  Python, C++, and Lisp. You
can  write, test,  and debug  code directly  from within  Emacs, which
makes it a great tool for software development.

In this tutorial,  we will cover the basics of  using Emacs, including
how to navigate  the interface, customize your settings,  and use some
of the most  powerful features of Emacs. We will  also explore some of
the more advanced features, such  as writing and debugging code, using
macros and scripts, and integrating with other tools.

Fill the ``.emacs`` file
========================


Install new packages
====================

Type      ``M-x:     list-packages``.      Search     for      example
``markdown-mode``. Click  on it and  then click again on  install. The
new package and mode will be available typing at next emacs restart or
typing: ``M-x:  markdown-mode``. if you  open a new  markdown document
you'll  now have  different highlighting  colors for  the text  inside
emacs3
