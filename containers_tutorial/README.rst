Introduction to Docker
======================

What is Docker?
---------------

Docker  is a  popular  platform for  building,  shipping, and  running
software  applications  in  containers.  Containers  are  lightweight,
standalone executable  packages that contain everything  needed to run
an application, including the  code, runtime, system tools, libraries,
and settings.

Docker can help you:

- Create  a  reproducible  research environment,  ensuring  that  your
  experiments can be replicated by others

- Share your research environment with collaborators, allowing them to
  easily reproduce and build upon your work

- Simplify  the installation  and  configuration  of complex  software
  tools, such as machine learning frameworks or simulation software

- Manage   multiple   research   projects  with   different   software
  dependencies and requirements


Getting Started with Docker
----------------------------

To get started with Docker, you'll  need to download and install it on
your computer. Docker is available  for Windows, macOS, and Linux, and
can be downloaded from the Docker website.

Introduction to Singularity
===========================

What is Singularity?
--------------------

Singularity  is  an  open-source  platform for  creating  and  running
containers  that are  optimized for  high-performance computing  (HPC)
environments. As a PhD student, you can use Singularity to manage your
research environment and simplify  your workflow. Singularity can help
you:

- Create  a  reproducible  research environment,  ensuring  that  your
  experiments can be replicated by others

- Share your research environment with collaborators, allowing them to
  easily reproduce and build upon your work

- Simplify  the installation  and  configuration  of complex  software
  tools, such as machine learning frameworks or simulation software

- Manage   multiple   research   projects  with   different   software
  dependencies and requirements


Getting Started with Singularity
--------------------------------

To get started  with Singularity, you'll need to  download and install
it on  your computer. Singularity is  available for Linux, and  can be
downloaded from the Singularity  website. Singularity does not require
root access, which makes it ideal for use in shared HPC environments.
