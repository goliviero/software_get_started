Introduction
============

What is bash?
-------------

Bash  is a  popular  shell  and command  language  used in  Unix-based
operating systems such  as Linux and macOS. It is  a powerful tool for
automating tasks, managing files  and directories, and running complex
commands and scripts.

If you are a PhD student working with data or performing computational
tasks,  Bash  can be  an  incredibly  useful  tool for  managing  your
workflow  and  simplifying your  work.  Some  common tasks  you  might
perform with Bash include:

- Automating  repetitive   tasks,  such   as  file  backups   or  data
  processing.
- Managing files  and directories, including searching,  renaming, and
  deleting files.
- Running complex  command-line tools, such as  data analysis software
  or simulation tools.
- Creating and running scripts to automate tasks and workflows.

Getting Started with Bash
-------------------------

To get started with Bash, you'll need access to a Unix-based operating
system, such  as Linux or  macOS. Most modern Unix-based  systems come
with Bash preinstalled, so you can get started right away.

Once you have  access to a Unix-based system with  Bash installed, you
can start using  Bash to manage your tasks and  workflows. Some common
Bash commands you might use include:

- `ls` - list files and directories.
- `cd` - change the current directory.
- `mkdir` - create a new directory.
- `rm` - remove a file or directory.
- `grep` - search for text within files.
- `awk` - manipulate and analyze text data.
- `sed` - perform text transformations.
