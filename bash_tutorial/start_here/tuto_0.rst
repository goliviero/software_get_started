Tutorial Goals
==============

.. note::

   This tutorial will be  data processing oriented because this is
   what our  new students are  interested by. It  can be relevant  or not
   depending on the field you are working but I'll try to stay as generic
   as possible.)
..

- Create a new script. Load a given environment.

- Manage paths and data i/o. Create new directories for a given run.

- Process a  file with an application  who take a data  file as input,
  create a new data file output, store logs in a log file.

- Launch  several jobs  on a  cluster using  ``sbatch`` with  the good
  options encapsulating the previous script.
