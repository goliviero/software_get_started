General remarks
===============

Welcome  on  this repository  centralizing  a  lot of  information  on
different  softwares  or  languages  used in  the  world  of  academic
research. My goal in my collaboration  in particle physics was to give
to new  students a  place to start  to learn how  to use  our software
stack. It can  be relevant (or not)  to you because I am  working on a
Particle Physics experiment so it can  be too specific for you but you
can adapt what you see here to your field or applications.

An  useful   way  to  get   documemtation  or  help  is   through  the
`stackoverflow  website   <https://stackoverflow.com/>`_.   It   is  a
question and answer website for  programmers. It will become your best
friend for each code or  software related questions.  People are smart
and share a lots of their code on it.

Also, `github <https://github.com/>`_  is also a good  place to get
software snippets you can copy and then adapt to your application.

Finally,  `ChatGPT <https://chat.openai.com/chat>`_  can be  also very
useful. This artificial intelligence chatbot using supervised learning
as  well  as  reinforcement  learning can  help  you  on  developping,
debugging, understand a code or  writing a documentation.  You can ask
him a lot of details on  errors, code, documentation but also start to
create some  atomic program  you'll use  in your  bigger applications.
You can try  to get more information from him  giving him more context
on who you  are, for example a  phd in particle physics  or a software
developper and he will go deeper in the explanations. Not 100% perfect
but can be helpful and worth  mentioning.  but can be helpful and it's
worth mentioning it.

Supported environments
----------------------

Linux is supported.

For now,  I have only  tested the  different tutorials on  my personal
machine which is:

.. code:: sh

   Linux Mint Dell-Latitude-5420 5.15.0-60-generic #66-Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS SMP x86_64 GNU/Linux
..

For Mac  user it  should be  close to Linux  user and  interface. Some
things can change for paths or  bash things. Please have a look online
if you encounter specific issue related to mac-usage.

For Windows people, well... Good luck.
