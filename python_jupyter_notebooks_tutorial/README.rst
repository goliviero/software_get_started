Introduction
============

What is Jupyter Notebook?
-------------------------

Python  Jupyter  Notebook  is a  web-based  interactive  computational
environment  that allows  users  to create  and  share documents  that
contain   live   code,   equations,  visualizations,   and   narrative
text.  Jupyter Notebook  is widely  used in  data science,  scientific
research, and education,  and is an essential tool  for anyone working
with Python.

Getting Started
---------------

To start using Jupyter Notebook, you  need to have Python installed on
your  computer. You  can  download Python  from  the official  website
(https://www.python.org/downloads/)  or  install  it using  a  package
manager                such                 as                Anaconda
(https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

Once you have Python installed, you can install Jupyter Notebook using
pip, the Python package manager:

.. code:: sh

   $ pip install jupyterlab
..

After installing  Jupyter Notebook, you  can launch it by  running the
following command in your terminal or command prompt:

.. code:: sh

   $ jupyter notebook
..

This will  open Jupyter Notebook  in your  web browser, where  you can
create and edit notebooks.

Creating a Notebook
===================

To create a  new notebook, click on the ``New``  button in the Jupyter
Notebook interface  and select  ``Python 3``  (or any  other supported
language) from the dropdown menu. This will create a new notebook with
an empty code cell.

You can then start typing Python code into the cell, and execute it by
pressing  the   ``Run``  button   (or  the   ``Shift+Enter``  keyboard
shortcut).   Jupyter Notebook  also supports  Markdown, a  lightweight
markup language  that allows you  to format text and  create headings,
lists, tables, and more.


Saving and Sharing Notebooks
============================

Jupyter Notebook  automatically saves  your work as  you type,  so you
don't have to worry about losing your  code or data. You can also save
your notebook manually by clicking on the ``Save`` button or using the
``Ctrl+S`` keyboard shortcut.

To share your notebook with others, you can export it as a PDF or HTML
file,  or upload  it to  a platform  like GitHub  or Jupyter  Notebook
Viewer.  You  can also  use Jupyter Notebook's  built-in collaboration
features to share your notebook in real-time with other users.
