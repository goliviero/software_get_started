Introduction
============

What is  Python Pandas?
-----------------------

Pandas is an open-source library for data manipulation and analysis in
Python.   It  provides data  structures  for  efficiently storing  and
manipulating  large   datasets,  as   well  as  tools   for  cleaning,
transforming, and analyzing data.

Pandas is built on top of NumPy, and its primary data structure is the
DataFrame, which  is a two-dimensional table-like  structure with rows
and columns. Pandas also provides  the Series data structure, which is
a one-dimensional labeled array.

Some of the key features of Pandas include:

- Handling of missing data: Pandas  provides robust tools for handling
 missing   data,  including   methods  for   filling,  dropping,   and
 interpolating missing values.

- Data alignment:  Pandas makes  it easy to  align data  from multiple
 sources, such as  different databases or CSV  files, by automatically
 aligning data based on the labels of the data.

- Data manipulation:  Pandas provides  a wide  range of  functions for
  manipulating data, including  filtering, sorting, grouping, merging,
  and pivoting.

- Time-series functionality:  Pandas provides  tools for  working with
  time-series data,  including resampling, time shifting,  and rolling
  window calculations.

- Data   visualization:   Pandas    integrates   with   popular   data
  visualization libraries, such as  Matplotlib and Seaborn, to provide
  easy-to-use tools for creating charts and graphs.

In  this  tutorial,  we  will  cover the  basic  concepts  of  Pandas,
including data structures, indexing, selection, and filtering. We will
also introduce some  of the more advanced features of  Pandas, such as
data aggregation, merging and joining, and time-series analysis.
