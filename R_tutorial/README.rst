Introduction
============

What is R?
----------

R is a  programming language and software  environment for statistical
computing and graphics. It is widely used among statisticians and data
analysts for data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization.

R  is an  open-source  project  and can  be  downloaded  and used  for
free. It runs on various  operating systems, including Windows, macOS,
and Linux.

Some  of the  features that  make R  popular among  data analysts  and
statisticians include:

- A  large  collection  of   pre-built  packages  for  data  analysis,
  visualization, and modeling
- A  flexible  and expressive  syntax  that  allows for  complex  data
  manipulations and statistical analyses
- High-quality  graphics  and  visualization capabilities,  with  many
  options for customization
- A large  and active community  of users and  contributors, providing
  support, documentation, and new packages


Getting Started with R
----------------------

To  get started  with  R,  you'll need  to  download  and install  the
software. You can  download the latest version of R  from the official
website at https://www.r-project.org/.

Once you have R installed, you can use it in a number of ways:

- Using  the command-line  interface,  which provides  a powerful  and
  flexible environment for data analysis and scripting
- Using an Integrated Development  Environment (IDE), such as RStudio,
  which  provides  a  more   user-friendly  interface  and  additional
  features for code editing, debugging, and project management
- Using  notebooks, such  as Jupyter  Notebooks or  R Markdown,  which
  combine code, text, and visualizations in a single document

Resources
=========

There are  many resources available  for learning R,  including online
tutorials, books, and courses. Some popular resources include:

- The official R documentation, which provides detailed information on
  R functions, packages, and syntax.
- RStudio's online learning resources, including interactive tutorials
  and courses.
- Books  on R  programming, such  as "R  for Data  Science" by  Hadley
  Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.
