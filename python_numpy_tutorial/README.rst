Introduction
============

What is Python Numpy?
---------------------

NumPy is a Python library used  for numerical computing. It stands for
Numerical Python. NumPy  provides an efficient interface  to store and
operate on  dense arrays of  data. It  is the fundamental  package for
scientific computing with Python.

NumPy  is an  open-source project  and is  used by  a large  number of
people around  the world for  various purposes such as  data analysis,
scientific research, and machine learning.

The core functionality of NumPy is  its ``ndarray`` object, which is a
multi-dimensional array that  can hold elements of the  same type. The
``ndarray`` object provides a wide range of functions for manipulating
and performing  operations on  arrays, such as  mathematical, logical,
and statistical operations.

NumPy  also provides  tools for  integrating C/C++  and Fortran  code,
which allows  users to  write high-performance  functions that  can be
called directly from Python.

In this tutorial, we will cover the basic concepts of NumPy, including
array creation, indexing, slicing, and  various operations that can be
performed on arrays.  We will also introduce some of the more advanced
features  of  NumPy,  such   as  broadcasting  and  ufuncs  (universal
functions).

If you are  familiar with Python programming and  have some experience
with arrays, this tutorial will help you get started with NumPy.
