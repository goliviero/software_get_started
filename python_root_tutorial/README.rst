Introduction
============

What is Python ROOT (PyROOT)?
-----------------------------

ROOT is a software framework developed by CERN for high-energy physics
data analysis.  It  provides a powerful suite of  tools for processing
and  analyzing large  datasets of  particle physics  experiments. With
PyROOT, you can use the full functionality of ROOT from within Python,
making it a powerful tool for scientific computing in Python.

PyROOT provides a  wide range of tools and functions  for working with
data, including  histogramming, fitting, and statistical  analysis. It
also provides  powerful visualization tools  for displaying data  in a
variety of formats, including 2D and 3D plots.

In this  tutorial, we will  cover the  basics of working  with PyROOT,
including how to create histograms,  perform basic operations on them,
and  manipulate their  structure.  We  will also  explore some  of the
powerful  data  analysis  and   visualization  functions  that  PyROOT
provides for working with data.

By the  end of this tutorial,  you will have a  solid understanding of
PyROOT and its  capabilities, and you will be ready  to start using it
in your  own high-energy physics  data analysis projects.  Whether you
are  just  starting  out  with   Python  or  looking  to  deepen  your
understanding of this powerful library, this tutorial is a great place
to start.


What is Python uproot?
----------------------

Uproot provides a fast and  memory-efficient way to access ROOT files,
which are widely used in the high-energy physics community for storing
and analyzing large datasets. With  Python Uproot, you can easily load
ROOT files  into Python and  manipulate them  using the full  power of
Python's data analysis tools.

In addition to reading and writing  ROOT files, Uproot also provides a
number  of  useful  tools  for   working  with  ROOT  data,  including
histogramming, plotting, and data filtering.

In this  tutorial, we  will cover  the basics  of working  with Python
Uproot,  including how  to read  and write  ROOT files,  perform basic
operations  on them,  and  manipulate their  structure.  We will  also
explore some of the powerful data analysis and visualization functions
that Uproot provides for working with ROOT data.
