Introduction
============

What is Doxygen?
----------------

Doxygen is a  tool used for generating documentation  from source code
in  various programming  languages.   It allows  developers to  create
documentation that  is easy to  read and  navigate, and it  supports a
variety of output formats such as HTML, LaTeX, and RTF.

Doxygen  uses  special  comments  in   the  source  code  to  generate
documentation. These comments are written  in a specific format, which
can  be  customized  using  a  configuration  file.   In  addition  to
generating documentation  for classes and functions,  Doxygen can also
create call graphs and inheritance diagrams.

Doxygen supports various programming languages including C, C++, Java,
Objective-C, Python,  and more. It  also includes support  for popular
documentation formats such as Markdown and Restructured Text.

Restructured Text is a markup language that allows for the creation of
structured  documents,   and  it  is  supported   by  Doxygen.   Using
Restructured Text  in conjunction with Doxygen,  developers can create
well-structured and readable documentation for their code.

In summary,  Doxygen is a  powerful tool for  generating documentation
from source  code, and it  supports various programming  languages and
documentation formats. By utilizing  Restructured Text, developers can
create documentation that is easy to read and navigate, and provides a
comprehensive overview of their code.
