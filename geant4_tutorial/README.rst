Introduction
============

What is Geant4?
---------------

Geant4 is a  software toolkit for simulating the  passage of particles
through matter. It is used extensively in high energy physics, medical
physics,  nuclear  physics,  and  space physics.  As  a  PhD  student,
learning Geant4 can help you  gain valuable skills in particle physics
and  simulation, which  can be  applied to  a wide  range of  research
areas.

Geant4 is  written in  C++, which  means that you  should have  a good
understanding  of  the  C++  programming  language  before  you  start
learning Geant4.  In addition  to C++,  you will also  need to  have a
basic  understanding of  particle physics  concepts, such  as particle
interactions and energy deposition.

Getting Started with Geant4
---------------------------

To get started with Geant4, you  will need to download and install the
software on your  computer. You can find the latest  version of Geant4
on the Geant4 website at https://geant4.web.cern.ch/. The website also
provides  documentation,  tutorials,  and  examples to  help  you  get
started with Geant4.

Once you have  installed Geant4, you can start learning  how to use it
by  going  through   the  tutorials  and  examples   provided  on  the
website. The  tutorials cover a  range of topics, from  basic particle
tracking  to more  advanced  topics like  electromagnetic physics  and
multi-threading.

When writing Geant4 code, it is important to follow best practices for
software  development. This  includes using  version control  software
like Git, writing  modular and well-documented code,  and testing your
code thoroughly before using it in production.

In  addition to  writing  your own  code,  you may  also  need to  use
external  libraries and  tools  when working  with  Geant4. These  can
include visualization tools like OpenGL and external data sources like
particle data tables.
